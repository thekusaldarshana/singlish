# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Singlish! We welcome contributions from the community to help improve the accuracy and performance of the engine.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/singlish.git
   cd singlish
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Project Structure

- `converter.ts`: Core logic for Singlish-to-Sinhala conversion.
- `ime-engine.ts`: Stateful IME class for real-time input.
- `hooks.ts`: React integration.
- `NativeMap.txt`: Reference for phonetic mappings.

### Making Changes

1. **Update Mappings**: If you find a missing phonetic mapping, check `converter.ts`. The `SINGLISH_TO_PHONEME` constant defines the raw tokenization rules.
2. **Verify Changes**: Ensure your changes don't break existing conversions. We recommend adding a test case for any new mapping.

### Coding Standards

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code.
- Follow the existing code style (indentation, variable naming).
- Keep functions pure where possible, especially in the converter.
