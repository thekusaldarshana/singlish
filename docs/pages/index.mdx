# Singlish

**Singlish** is an industry-grade, real-time transliteration engine for converting Romanized Sinhala (Singlish) into Sinhala script. Developed by **Siyabasa Sinhala NLP**, a department of **Remeinium Labs**, it powers the next generation of Sinhala input methods.

## Overview

Singlish provides a seamless bridge between English QWERTY keyboards and Sinhala text generation. Unlike simple dictionary lookups, Singlish uses a **stateful Prefix Trie engine** and **context-aware phoneme mapping** to handle complex grammatical constructs like *Sanyaka* and *Rakaraansaya*.

It is designed for:
- **High Performance**: Optimized for low-latency input (IMEs).
- **Correctness**: Handles complex grammatical constructs like *Sanyaka* and *Rakaraansaya*.
- **Flexibility**: Works as a library for Node.js, a React hook for web apps, or a standalone engine.

## Features

- 🚀 **Real-time Conversion**: Type as you speak (e.g., "ka" → "ක", "kra" → "ක්‍ර").
- ⚛️ **React Integration**: Built-in hooks for easy integration with React textareas.
- 🧠 **Smart Tokenization**: Greedy matching algorithm ensures the longest valid phoneme is always selected.
- 📱 **Mobile Ready**: Experimental support for mobile input events.
- 🔧 **Type-Safe**: Written in TypeScript with full type definitions.
